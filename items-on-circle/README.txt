A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/Bigqr.

 A Sass version of Ana's work consisting on putting items on circle with CSS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle.

Made a mixin to make everything easy to use. Just set the size of the circle and the number of items to place.
